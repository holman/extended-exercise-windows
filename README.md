## Previously-extended windows
There are some companies that *started out* with an extended exercise window, but reached some sort of endpoint (IPO, acquisition, etc) where an exercise window isn't relevant these days. It's still great to see these companies start from solid beginnings, though, so we'd still like to continue to acknowledge them here, especially since they likely have chosen other fair policies that still are important today.

## VCs

It's worth noting that Andreessen Horowitz [has come out in strong favor of the 90 day window](http://a16z.com/2016/06/23/options-timing/). If you feel strongly about extended exercise windows, it might be worth considering whether a16z portfolio companies are a good fit for you.
